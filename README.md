# Konpemo
AMJV Project for the second year of our Engineering School in Télécom SudParis by LY Victor and COUDURIER Ivan.
This is our first game using Unity.

# Goal
This game is a Real Time Strategy / Capture The Flag type of game where your goal is to assault an enemy base and take the flag to your spawn.
The player can control different units named Konpemo that can have several moves.

# In Game
The player can control each unit individually or in group to take the enemy flag. The first unit that takes the flag will become the king and will have to come back to the spawn. Enemies will try to take down the king.
There are two ways of winning: Taking back the flag or killing all the enemies.
There are also two ways of losing: All your units die or your king dies.
